            Email marketing is a digital strategy that involves sending targeted messages to prospects 
            and customers through email. It allows businesses to communicate directly with their audience, 
            nurturing leads and fostering loyalty.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Unlike other marketing channels, email provides a direct line of communication that you own, 
            independent of algorithm changes or platform restrictions. With an average ROI of $36 for every 
            $1 spent, email marketing remains one of the most effective marketing strategies available.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
            Modern email marketing goes far beyond simple newsletters. Today's sophisticated campaigns 
            leverage personalization, automation, and data-driven insights to deliver the right message 
            to the right person at the right time.

            <p className="mb-4 text-lg">Unlike social media where algorithm changes can reduce your visibility, email gives you ownership of the communication channel. Your messages land directly in subscribers' inboxes, allowing consistent touchpoints throughout the customer journey.</p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-lg">Through personalized content and segmentation, you can demonstrate that you understand your customers' needs and preferences, building trust that translates into brand advocacy and word-of-mouth referrals.</p>
